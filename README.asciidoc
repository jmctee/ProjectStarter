Project Starter
---------------

The purpose of this project is to support quick creation of new Java/Groovy project that imports some common, useful libraries and provides simple examples of their use.

Unlike most github projects, rather than forking ProjectStarter, you clone, then remove links to the original project and start over with a fresh project. This process is contained in the bootstrap script included with this project.

Bootstrap Process
-----------------

To manually bootstrap a project:

```
export PROJECT_NAME=<your project name>

git clone git@github.com:jmctee/ProjectStarter.git
mv ProjectStarter $PROJECT_NAME
cd $PROJECT_NAME

rm -Rf .git TODO

git init
git add .gitignore build.gradle src
git commit -am "${PROJECT_NAME}: bootstrapped from https://github.com/jmctee/ProjectStarter"
git status
git log

gradle cleanIdea
gradle idea
gradle build
```

Project now ready for use, open in IntelliJ Idea and got to town!

TODOs
-----

I will be adding more functionality over time. If you have any cool ideas to include, please feel free to send me a pull request.
